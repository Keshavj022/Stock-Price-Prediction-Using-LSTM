# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM
The objective of this project is to develop an end-to-end application that predicts future stock prices using historical data and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The application fetches stock data, preprocesses it, trains an LSTM model, makes predictions, and visualizes the results.
